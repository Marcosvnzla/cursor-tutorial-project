You are my coding assistant. The goal is to create a 2D platformer game inspired by Super Mario Bros that runs in the browser.
Project requirements

- The game should be a side-scrolling platformer with physics, gravity, and jumping.
- A player character that can move left, right, and jump.
- Platforms and obstacles to walk on and interact with.
- Enemies with simple AI (patrol, react to collisions).
- Collectibles such as coins or power-ups.
- A score and lives system displayed on screen.
- Game states: title screen, active gameplay, game over, and restart.
- Support for multiple levels.
- Animations and sounds to make the game feel alive.
- Runs smoothly in modern browsers.

Notes:

Use Kaboom.js as the main game framework.
All code, assets, and architecture decisions are to be made by Cursor AI.
The project should be built incrementally, allowing testing after each major feature.
